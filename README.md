# Math Ain't Evil

Math Ain't Evil is a small site which demonstrates how to solve certain math
problems, poses new ones, and discusses topics in mathematics. It was created
out of a desire to make mathematics more accessible to a broader audience.

From a developer's perspective this site is extremely simple. It consists of a 
variety of TeX files rendered through MathJax with a minimum of fuss about 
presentation. To contribute to Math Ain't Evil, write an article and create 
a pull request, adding the file to the list in files.yaml and to the `posts`
directory.
