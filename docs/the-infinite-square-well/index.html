    <span class="post-title">The Infinite Square Well</span>
    <p>One of the most common problems found in quantum mechanics textbooks, is that of the infinite square well. While it is a very abstracted model, the infinite square well illustrates many of the principles of quantum mechanics and can actually serve as a useful model in cases of very steep potentials.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get to the actual problem. Consider a particle of mass <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and energy <span class="math inline">\(E &gt; 0\)</span> trapped in a potential <span class="math inline">\(V(x)\)</span> as follows. <span class="math display">\[V(x) = \begin{cases}
    0  &amp; 0 \leq x \leq L \\
    \infty  &amp; \text{otherwise}  
 \end{cases}\]</span> Now, while this problem is phrased in the context of Physics it reduces to a simple differential equation. Namely, our particle inside the box will satisfy the time independent Schr&#246;dinger equation <span class="math display">\[\left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x) \right] \psi = E \psi  .\]</span> In our case we know the particle can not exist outside of the box for the purely reason that a particle shouldn&#8217;t exist in an infinite potential. However, mathematically it is equally clear that as <span class="math inline">\(V \longrightarrow\infty\)</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{2m(V - E)}{\hbar^2} \psi = \psi&#39;&#39;\]</span> can only be satisfied by <span class="math inline">\(\psi = 0\)</span>. So for <span class="math inline">\(x \notin [(0, l)]\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\psi(x) = 0\)</span>. What about inside the square well? We can start by solving the differential equation as follow, first let&#8217;s simplify some of the constants. <span class="math display">\[\psi&#39;&#39; = -k^2\psi, \qquad k = \frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar}\]</span> Now as <span class="math inline">\(\psi&#39;&#39; = \alpha \psi\)</span> we know we are looking at an equation of the form <span class="math inline">\(e^{\sqrt{\alpha} x}\)</span>. In our case, that is <span class="math display">\[\psi(x) = A e^{ikx} + Bx + C.\]</span> This is the general solution to our differential equation. In order for our solution to satisfy the physical constraints of the wave equation it must be continuous, thus <span class="math inline">\(\psi(0) = \psi(L) = 0\)</span>. Applying that constraint we immediately see that <span class="math inline">\(C = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B = 0\)</span>. Furthermore, we can use Euler&#8217;s formula to expand <span class="math inline">\(e^{ikx}\)</span> to see that <span class="math display">\[\psi(x) = A\big[ \cos(kx) + i\sin(kx) \big].\]</span> Now note that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a complex variable so we can express it as <span class="math inline">\(A = \alpha -i\beta\)</span>, for real numbers <span class="math inline">\(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>. With that simplification in hand we can write <span class="math display">\[\psi(x) = \alpha \cos(kx) + \beta\sin(kx).\]</span> Now applying our boundary conditions we see that as <span class="math inline">\(\cos(0) = 1\)</span> the <span class="math inline">\(\cos\)</span> term must disappear. <span class="math display">\[\psi(0) = \alpha = 0.\]</span> The case where <span class="math inline">\(x = L\)</span> is more interesting, for a continuous wave function <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> must satisfy <span class="math display">\[\psi(L) = 0 = \beta \sin(kL).\]</span> This is true only when <span class="math display">\[kL = n\pi, \qquad n = 0,1,2,3\dots\]</span> Thus <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is <strong>quantized</strong> by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and since <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is determined by the energy of the particle, this implies that only certain energies can exist! <span class="math display">\[\frac{\sqrt{2mE_n}}{\hbar}L = n \pi \implies E_n = \frac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL}, \qquad 
  n = 0,1,2,3, \dots\]</span> This quantization is one of the most fundamental results of quantum mechanics, stating that only certain energy levels can exist. This simple model gives quantization as predicted by the Bohr model of the atom.</p>
<p>Of course, we aren&#8217;t done yet. To get the full solution we must apply the conditions of normalization, namely <span class="math display">\[\int_{\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 \dd{x} = 1.\]</span> In our case that simplifies to the following formula for <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[\int_{\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 \dd{x} 
  = \beta^2 \int_{0}^L \sin^2(\frac{n\pi x}{L}) \dd{x} 
  = \beta^2 \left [ \frac{x}{2} - \frac{L\sin(\frac{2n\pi x}{L})}{3n\pi} \Bigg|_0^L \right]
  = \frac{L\beta^2}{2} = 1.\]</span> Which implies that <span class="math inline">\(\beta = \sqrt{2/L}\)</span>. Thus our energy eigenfunctions are given as <span class="math display">\[\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\sin(\frac{n\pi x}{L}).\]</span> One of the things that can be confusing about this solution is the arbitrary nature of the coordinates. Suppose instead of picking an interval <span class="math inline">\([0, L]\)</span> we used the interval <span class="math inline">\([-\frac{L}{2}, \frac{L}{2}]\)</span>? One of the cornerstones of physics is that the natural laws are independent of reference frame, so theoretically the solution to that formula should be identical. However, if you solve it explicitly you end up with a <span class="math inline">\(\sin\)</span> <strong>and</strong> a <span class="math inline">\(\cos\)</span> term.</p>
<p>While this may look different, this is in fact identical to our solution under the transformation <span class="math inline">\(x&#39; = x - \frac{L}{2}\)</span>. Note that <span class="math display">\[\psi_n(x&#39;) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin(\frac{n \pi x}{L} - \frac{n \pi}{2}).\]</span> Recall that that <span class="math inline">\(\sin(x - \frac{\pi}{2}) = \cos(x)\)</span>, thus the previous equation gives us <span class="math inline">\(\sin\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\cos\)</span> depending on <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[\psi_n(x&#39;) = \begin{cases}
    \frac{2}{L} \sin(\frac{n\pi x}{L}) &amp; n = 0, 2, 4, \dots \\
    \frac{2}{L} \cos(\frac{n\pi x}{L}) &amp; n = 1, 3, 5, \dots \\
  \end{cases}\]</span> While this is a minor point its an important one. Often students first exposed to quantum mechanics will be confused by the variety of solutions to a given problem, when in fact they are simply the same solution in different coordinate systems.</p>
