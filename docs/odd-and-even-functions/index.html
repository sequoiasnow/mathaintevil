    <span class="post-title">Odd And Even Functions</span>
    <p>A common theme in physics is the classification of odd and even functions. Often these concepts are referred to without reference and can confuse aspiring undergrads, myself included. In this article I&#8217;ll try to shine some light on a method of solving differential equations that is often used, but rarely understood.</p>
<p>Suppose we are trying to solve the following differential equation where <span class="math inline">\(V(x)\)</span> is a symetric potential. <span class="math display">\[\psi&#39;&#39; + V(x)\psi + C\psi = 0\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(C \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> is a constant and <span class="math inline">\(V(x)\)</span> is symmetric, meaning that <span class="math display">\[V(x) = V(-x).\]</span> Some examples of symmetric potentials include parabolas, the <span class="math inline">\(\cos\)</span> function, potential wells, etc... In fact any <strong>even</strong> function is symmetric. We define <strong>even</strong> exactly as stated above. So what is odd?</p>
<p>Odd is a function such as <span class="math inline">\(x^3\)</span> that flips orientation about the y-axis. Stated simply, and <strong>odd</strong> function satisfies <span class="math display">\[f(-x) = -f(x).\]</span> Some examples include <span class="math inline">\(\sin\)</span>, potential jumps, &#8220;odd&#8221; polynomials, etc... So how can we use this property to solve our differential equation?</p>
<p>The main idea here is that any function can be broken into odd and even components. Given a function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> we can break it into the even component <span class="math inline">\(f_+\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_-\)</span> as follows. <span class="math display">\[f_+ \equiv \frac{f(x) + f(-x)}{2} \qquad\qquad 
 f_- \equiv \frac{f(x) - f(-x)}{2}\]</span> Note that these functions are most certainly even and odd by construction. Where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is not even <span class="math inline">\(f_+\)</span> is zero. Where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is not odd, <span class="math inline">\(f_-\)</span> is zero. Thus, if we just add these functions we get <span class="math display">\[f_+ + f_- = f.\]</span> We can trivially note that these functions are unique. The proof follows by contradiction. Suppose that another even function <span class="math inline">\(f_+&#39;\)</span> existed that agrees with <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at every point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is even and is zero at all other points. Then <span class="math inline">\(f_+&#39; = f_+\)</span>. The proof for the uniqueness of <span class="math inline">\(f_-\)</span> is just as simple.</p>
<p>So how do we use these functions to simplify our equation? Because differentiation is linear we can break apart our differential equation into two components, one for the even function and one for the odd.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{gathered}
  \psi&#39;&#39;_+ + V(x)\psi_+ + C\psi_+ = 0 \\
  \psi&#39;&#39;_- + V(x)\psi_- + C\psi_- = 0\end{gathered}\]</span></p>
<p>Each of these can prove much easier to solve than the equation as a whole. Moreover, in the case of physics this can give rise to quantization of even and odd functions that can be added together where an explicit form might not easily be found.</p>
<p>In practice this also allows us to examine only one half of the boundary conditions at a time leading to a smaller number of coefficients that need to be solved for.</p>
